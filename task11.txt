1. LangChain

-An opensource framework for building apps with Large Language Models (LLMs).

-Allows chaining together prompts, models, and external data sources (APIs, databases).


2. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

-An AI technique that combines LLMs with external data retrieval for more accurate responses.

-Uses a retriever and a generator (to create answers using those documents).



3. LLMs (Large Language Models)

-AI models trained on massive text datasets to generate human-like language.

Examples: GPT-4, Llama 2.

-Can answer questions, summarize,translate, and generate content, but limited to their training data.



4. FAISS

-A library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors.

-Commonly used to quickly find relevant text/document embeddings in large datasets for RAG and search systems.


5. Vector

-A mathematical representation of data (e.g., text, image) as a list of numbers (embedding).

-Used for comparing similarity between pieces of data in AI systems.


6. VectorDB (Vector Database)

-A database designed to store and search vectors (embeddings) efficiently.

-Enables fast retrieval of similar documents for RAG and semantic search.

Examples: Pinecone,FAISS.


7. Generative AI

A broad category of AI that creates new content (text, images, music, etc.) from learned data patterns or data sets.

-Includes LLMs, image generators, and more.


8. GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks)

-A type of generative AI model with two networks (generator and discriminator) competing to create realistic data.

-Widely used for generating images, videos, and synthetic data.
